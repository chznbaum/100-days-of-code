# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: May 1, 2017

**Active Coding Time:** 4 hours, 16 minutes

**Commits:** 14

### Thoughts: 
The past month has been a whirlwind, but I'm officially rebooting the #100DaysOfCode challenge again. This time, I will make a concerted effort to not only code for an hour every day, but to make at least one commit every day, and to utilize [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com) to measure my code-editing time.

As far as measurable metrics went, today was a great start. 10 commits counted towards today, as well as 4 commits on a branch that hasn't been merged yet. According to WakaTime, I've actively edited code for 4 hours and 16 minutes today.

The work I'm doing now is pretty interesting. I got a really basic Ruby gem made and added to [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/chznbaum_view_tool), and I'm getting to a point in my portfolio resign where I can start working with the styles since the functionality in Ruby is just about there.

### Work:
* View Tool (Ruby):
  * Pushed changes to [GitHub](https://github.com/chznbaum/chznbaum_view_tool) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/chznbaum_view_tool)
* Portfolio (Ruby on Rails):
  * Implemented my basic Ruby gem to generate the footer copyright content.
  * Implemented authorization through [petergate](https://rubygems.org/gems/petergate) to restrict certain items and actions to certain users.
  * Setup master layout styles and helper methods, as well as implementing embedded Google Map on contact page.
  * Pushed changes (except current branch) to [GitHub](https://github.com/chznbaum/rails-portfolio). It will still be a while before it gets deployed to production and viewed live.

Pressed to get the initial styles of the app done, even if it took working well past midnight. In the process, managed to get the next day's requirements done.

### Work:
* Portfolio (Ruby on Rails):
  * Implemented initial styling of user pages
  * Established layouts with initial styling for default, blogs, and portfolio
  * Implemented partials for navs, mastheads, modules, and footers
