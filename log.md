# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: March 16, 2017

### Thoughts: 
Keeping up with these challenges is...a real challenge! ðŸ˜…

I'm prioritizing the #30Days30Sites challenge for now as a way to work on my efficiency and priorities as a developer, as well as an awesome way to expand my portfolio. As I have time, I will dip back into #DailyCSSImages and #JavaScript30 to continue building up those skills.

As far as additional technologies to learn, the plan is:
* Current: VueJS, Webpack and ES6 syntax
* Followed by:
  * ReactJS
  * CSS Grid

I'm excited to keep up the momentum I've had over the last 7 months and learn new things. My goal is by the end of #30Days30Sites to be prepared to get a fulltime Front-End Developer job with a great user-centered company or to take on freelance clients.
