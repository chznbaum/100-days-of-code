# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: March 16, 2017

### Thoughts: 
Keeping up with these challenges is...a real challenge! üòÖ

I'm prioritizing the #30Days30Sites challenge for now as a way to work on my efficiency and priorities as a developer, as well as an awesome way to expand my portfolio. As I have time, I will dip back into #DailyCSSImages and #JavaScript30 to continue building up those skills.

As far as additional technologies to learn, the plan is:
* Current: VueJS, Webpack and ES6 syntax
* Followed by:
  * ReactJS
  * CSS Grid

I'm excited to keep up the momentum I've had over the last 7 months and learn new things. My goal is by the end of #30Days30Sites to be prepared to get a fulltime Front-End Developer job with a great user-centered company or to take on freelance clients.

    * Redesigned to pair well with my business cards and show more projects since I wasn't satisfied with the last redesign
    * Pushed changes to [GitHub](https://github.com/chznbaum/chznbaum.github.io), and it can be viewed on the [live site](http://chazonabaum.com/)

## Day 1: March 17, 2017

### Thoughts:
Oh my gosh, Codepen allows complete customization of the CSS on the pro profiles, and it is glorious! üòç I feel like I have the best part of Myspace back. I spent a good portion of the morning/early afternoon working to make it just right. Now it pairs well with my business cards and website, so they feel like more of a branded look.

Downside is the time spent on my Codepen profile meant less time for the #30Days30Sites challenge for today. Went with something pretty basic that just plays around with the layout, has a Google Map and a modal for RSVP. So tired, but glad I got it done.

## Day 2: March 18, 2017

### Thoughts:
The kids were a handful, and I had a migraine all day, so I was thinking I'd knock today's challenge out quickly.

![So good luck with that](https://media.giphy.com/media/4mQAsYNaFGbHG/giphy.gif)

Of course, when I try to do things quickly and intend to make them as simple as possible, they don't always turn out so simple. I saw different design concepts I wanted to try out just to see if I could figure out how to do them because they looked cool.

So I spent way more time than I intended to. One of these days I'll go to bed at a decent hour.

Since it's especially valid tonight, a repeat:

## Day 3: March 19, 2017

### Thoughts:
Ok, if there's anything where simplicity is not just nice but an actual requirement, it's a landing page. This made a great opportunity to force myself to do a simple design, keep it on my existing brand, and still try a couple things I hadn't done before. This was really fun to work on, and I was excited to get it done within about an hour and a half.

## Day 4: March 20, 2017

### Thoughts:
So I understand that I have a tendency to stay up late working on things I'm interested in...like 3:00 in the morning late. Not great when you have two littles that will be up by 7. So some adjustments need to be made.

The prompts for the #30Days30Sites challenge come in the late afternoon for me, which leads to me doing them after the kids go to bed rather than at their naptime or another better time. So tonight I set up the HTML and did some of the pre-work on the design, sourcing graphics and getting a feel for how online menus tend to look and function. However, I will wait until tomorrow morning to actually work on putting together the CSS and any JavaScript functionality. This should get me on a better schedule with remaining prompts so that I'm less likely to excitedly stay up all night when that's not a great option.

You can't stay up all night if you're doing the work in the daytime.

### Work:
* #30Days30Sites:
  * Day 5 Challenge: Menu
    * Set up HTML structure locally and acquired graphics

## Day 5: March 21, 2017

### Thoughts:
This time, I figured, I had the HTML set up, and I could throw together amenu page pretty quickly. The longer I looked at what I was working on, though, the more dissatisfied I was with it. The card approach I was using seemed off, better suited to retail. So by the middle of the day I scrapped it altogether.

Instead, I decided to try out a chalkboard look I'd seen in some trendy menu designs. This is sure to look more interesting, but the photoshopping involved! üò© I'm spending more time on that than anything else.

### Work:
* #30Days30Sites:
  * Day 5 Challenge: Menu
    * Restarted project. Started photoshopping graphics.

## Day 6: March 22, 2017

### Thoughts:
So I've done several days of the #30Days30Sites challenge, and at this point I have noticed some things:

* I haven't really had the time to work on any Vue or other new front-end technologies.
* I'm interested in experimenting with frameworks other than Bootstrap and Materialize, like Foundation and jQueryUI, to see how their strengths and weaknesses differ in streamlining the front-end development process. Like with Vue, haven't actually had the time to play around with them like I'd like to.
* I can get pages churned out in a day, but I'm producing more hacky code in some projects just to make sure it looks good enough from the browser to not be completely embarrassing. Not how I like to do things, especially when I need more of my code to look polished.
* I'm devoting largely the same amount of time to projects that really draw passion out of me as ones that I'm not nearly as excited about, and I think it shows.

I'd already come up with a system for managing my time to ensure that I could juggle caring for the kids all day, running the budding nonprofit, building projects, searching for work, blogging as I can, and learning new code. And knocking out a site in a day takes up too much time in any one day to keep that system from collapsing.

However...

I really enjoy the concept of the #30Days30Sites challenge, and many of the challenge concepts are useful to get me trying different layouts, styles, and types of sites. And it has been encouraging me to be more efficient and make different choices on some projects. I want to retain as much of the benefit to this as possible.

So I see two possible options:

1. Work on a #30Days30Sites challenge for a much shorter span of time each day, understanding that it may take a few days or a week to ship a site I'm happy with (both in the browser and the actual code).
2. Work on #30Days30Sites challenges in spurts, a day or two days at a time, where other items take second priority. In between challenges, my regular structure would be in place, with learning taking a bigger chunk than it usually does.

Personally, I'm leaning toward the latter. I'll keep a running tally of what each of the challenges are for each numbered day, and then work through them in these little sprints. If a particular day's challenge doesn't inspire me, then I'll skip it and come back to it.

## Day 7: March 23, 2017

### Thoughts:
I've decided that as I complete projects, I'm going to share what the process behind them look like: notes, flowcharts, sketches, etc. One, because folks just starting out don't always realize that these planning tools should often come first (and make solving problems easier). And two, because it gives a glimpse at my thought process and how I work, either for folks to see what they can steal for themselves or for potential employers to feel comfortable with my process.

I'm working on figuring out exactly how I'd want to lay it out within my website, as well as if there are any tools I'd like to try to simplify some of my existing methods. [Paul](https://twitter.com/CodePaulCode) mentioned [draw.io](https://draw.io) and its ability to save charts directly into GitHub or a cloud service, so I'll check it out.

Otherwise, got an idea for a project to work on and put a good amount of work into it. For right now, it's a super secret project (I don't do those often), so not too many details for now. Should take a few days to complete.
