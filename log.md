# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: March 16, 2017

### Thoughts: 
Keeping up with these challenges is...a real challenge! üòÖ

I'm prioritizing the #30Days30Sites challenge for now as a way to work on my efficiency and priorities as a developer, as well as an awesome way to expand my portfolio. As I have time, I will dip back into #DailyCSSImages and #JavaScript30 to continue building up those skills.

As far as additional technologies to learn, the plan is:
* Current: VueJS, Webpack and ES6 syntax
* Followed by:
  * ReactJS
  * CSS Grid

I'm excited to keep up the momentum I've had over the last 7 months and learn new things. My goal is by the end of #30Days30Sites to be prepared to get a fulltime Front-End Developer job with a great user-centered company or to take on freelance clients.

    * Pushed changes to [GitHub](https://github.com/chznbaum/chznbaum.github.io), and it can be viewed on the [live site](http://chazonabaum.com/)

## Day 1: March 17, 2017

### Thoughts:
Oh my gosh, Codepen allows complete customization of the CSS on the pro profiles, and it is glorious! üòç I feel like I have the best part of Myspace back. I spent a good portion of the morning/early afternoon working to make it just right. Now it pairs well with my business cards and website, so they feel like more of a branded look.

Downside is the time spent on my Codepen profile meant less time for the #30Days30Sites challenge for today. Went with something pretty basic that just plays around with the layout, has a Google Map and a modal for RSVP. So tired, but glad I got it done.
